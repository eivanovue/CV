I am an extremely enthusiastic Programmer and Junior Web Developer studying at University of Kent who has a sharp mind and unsatisfiable hunger for knowledge. I like to solve problems alongisde my colleagues, but more than that I love to collaborate with people by using creative and functional processes to build clean test-driven code with future for the real world! I am looking forward to working in a tech industry as a developer within a lively team that I can contribute to and learn from in equal measure.
